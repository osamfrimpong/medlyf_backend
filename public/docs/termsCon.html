        <h3>4. AUTHORIZATION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT; IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTHCARE PROVIDER RELATIONSHIPS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDER LISTS</h3>
        In connection with using the Site and the Services to locate and schedule appointments with Healthcare Providers, you understand that:
        
        <p>YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CHOOSING YOUR OWN HEALTHCARE PROVIDER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DETERMINING WHETHER THE APPLICABLE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER IS SUITABLE FOR YOUR HEALTHCARE NEEDS BASED ON SPECIALTY, EXPERIENCE, QUALIFICATION, LICENSES AND OTHER IMPORTANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COULD IMPACT YOUR CARE.</p>
        
        <p>Medlyf or its designee takes certain limited steps to verify that Healthcare Providers participating in the Services hold certain active licenses, certifications or registrations required by the laws of Ghana to practice the specialties of the services offered by them. Medlyf may also exclude Healthcare Providers from our Services who, in Medlyf’s discretion, have engaged in inappropriate or unprofessional conduct.</p>
        
        <p>Some Healthcare Providers listed through the Services enter into contracts with us, and may pay us a fee in order to be marketed through or to use the Services. To help you find Healthcare Providers who may be suitable for your needs, and enable the maximum choice and diversity of Healthcare Providers participating in the Services, we will provide you with lists and/or profiles of Healthcare Providers. These results are based on information that you provide to us, such as insurance information, geographical location, and healthcare specialty. They may also be based on other criteria (including, for example, Healthcare Provider availability, past selections by and/or ratings of Healthcare Providers by you or by other Medlyf users, and past experience of Medlyf users with Healthcare Providers). Note that Medlyf:
        <p>a. does not recommend or endorse any Healthcare Providers</p>
        <p>b. does not make any representations or warranties with respect to these Healthcare Providers or the quality of the healthcare services they may provide</p>
        <p>c. does not receive any additional fees from Healthcare Providers for featuring them (i.e., higher or better placement on lists) through the Services (subject to Sponsored Results as described below). To the extent that Medlyf serves as a platform for, or provides technical support to, the provider directory associated with your health coverage, Healthcare Providers will appear in the directory based on criteria determined by your health plan or plan sponsor, as applicable. We may show you advertisements or sponsored results (“Sponsored Results”) on the Site, including above the search results. Medlyf receives additional fees from Healthcare Providers for providing Sponsored Results. Sponsored Results shown through the Services are not, and should not be considered, an endorsement or recommendation by Medlyf of the Healthcare Provider.</p>

        <h4>16.2 Changes to These Terms of Use</h4>
        We may change these Terms of Use and the other documents that are part of the Agreement at any time, as we reasonably deem appropriate. Upon any such change, we will post the amended terms on the Site; we may also attempt to notify you in some other way. Your continued use of the Site and/or the Services following such posting shall constitute your affirmative acknowledgement of the Terms of Use or other applicable Agreement document, the modification, and agreement to abide and be bound by the Terms of Use or other applicable Agreement document, as amended. We encourage you to periodically review these Terms of Use and the Agreement. IF AT ANY TIME YOU CHOOSE NOT TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING FOLLOWING ANY SUCH MODIFICATIONS HERETO, THEN YOU MUST STOP USING THE SITE AND THE SERVICES.
        
        <h4>16.3 Limitation of Claims</h4>
        No action arising under or in connection with this Agreement, regardless of the form, may be brought by you more than one (6) months after the cause of action arose; actions brought thereafter are forever barred.
        
        <h4>16.4 Choice of Law; Arbitration Clause and Class Action Waiver – Important – Please Review as This Affects Your Legal Rights</h4>
        We hope that we can work out any disagreements you might have with Medlyf. But if there is a dispute that needs to be further resolved, that process will take place according to this section. This Agreement shall be deemed to have been entered into and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Ghana as applied to contracts made and to be performed entirely within Ghana. YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DISPUTES RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this Agreement to arbitrate. YOU ARE WAIVING THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR COLLECTIVE CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to the proceeding. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use or the Agreement.
        
        <h4>16.5 Severability</h4>
        In the event any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unimpaired. Further, the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a provision that comes closest to the intention of the parties that underlie the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision, except to the extent no such provision is valid, legal and enforceable, in which case such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the other provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
        
        <h4>16.6 Entire Agreement</h4>
        This Agreement and any supplemental terms, policies, rules and guidelines posted through the Services, each of which are incorporated herein by reference, including the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us and supersede all previous written or oral agreements. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. The failure of Medlyf to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right
        provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.
        
        <h4>16.7 Headings</h4>
        The headings of the sections of this Agreement are for convenience only, do not form a part hereof, and in no way limit, define, describe, modify, interpret or construe the meaning, scope or intent of this Agreement or any terms or conditions therein.
